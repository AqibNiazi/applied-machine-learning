# Lecture 6: Instance-Based vs Model-Based Learning

This repository provides clear and concise notes on **Instance-Based Learning** and **Model-Based Learning**, two fundamental learning paradigms in Machine Learning. The content is adapted from structured Notion notes and is suitable for **students, interviews, and quick revision**.

## 🔹 Instance-Based Learning (Memory-Based Learning)

### 📌 What is Instance-Based Learning?

Instance-Based Learning is a learning approach where the model **stores training instances** and makes predictions by **comparing new inputs with stored examples**. There is no explicit model built during training.

Learning happens at **prediction time**, which is why it is also called **Lazy Learning**.

---

### 🧠 Key Characteristics

- Stores most or all training data
- No explicit training phase
- Lazy learning approach
- High computation during prediction
- Sensitive to noise and irrelevant features

---

### 📍 Example: k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

**How it works:**

1. Store all labeled training instances
2. Compute distance between new input and stored instances
3. Select the _k_ nearest neighbors
4. Predict using majority vote (classification) or average (regression)

**Real-World Applications:**

- Recommendation systems
- Handwritten digit recognition

---

### ✅ Advantages

- Simple and intuitive
- No training time required
- Easily adapts to new data

---

### ❌ Disadvantages

- High memory consumption
- Slow prediction on large datasets
- Sensitive to noisy data

---

## 🔹 Model-Based Learning

### 📌 What is Model-Based Learning?

Model-Based Learning builds an **explicit mathematical or statistical model** from training data. The learned model is then used to make predictions on unseen data.

Learning happens during the **training phase**, and prediction is fast.

---

### 🧠 Key Characteristics

- Builds a generalized model
- Computationally intensive training phase
- Fast inference
- Low memory usage after training
- Better generalization capability

---

### 📍 Example: Linear Regression

**How it works:**

1. Learn model parameters from training data
2. Build a mathematical function
3. Use the function to predict unseen values

**Real-World Applications:**

- House price prediction
- Sales forecasting

---

### ✅ Advantages

- Fast predictions
- Requires less memory
- More robust to noise

---

### ❌ Disadvantages

- Requires retraining to incorporate new data
- Model assumptions may reduce flexibility
