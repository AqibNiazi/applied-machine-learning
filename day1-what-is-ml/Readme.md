# Day 1: What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a field of computer science that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for every task.

## Difference Between Explicit Programming and Machine Learning

- **Explicit Programming**: In traditional programming, developers write explicit instructions (rules) for the computer to follow. The program behaves exactly as coded.
- **Machine Learning**: Instead of writing rules, we provide data and an algorithm. The algorithm learns patterns from the data and makes predictions or decisions based on those patterns.

## Scenarios Where Machine Learning is Helpful

- **Email Spam Classifier**: Automatically identifies and filters out unwanted emails.
- **Image Classification**: Recognizes objects or people in images.
- **Speech Recognition**: Converts spoken language into text.
- **Recommendation Systems**: Suggests products, movies, or content based on user preferences.

## Data Mining and Data Analytics

- **Data Analytics**: The process of examining datasets to draw conclusions, often using statistical and visualization techniques.
- **Data Mining**: The process of discovering patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data, often using machine learning algorithms.
