# Lecture 2: AI vs Machine Learning vs Deep Learning

## Definitions and Differences

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** The broad field of creating machines or software that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.
- **Machine Learning (ML):** A subset of AI focused on algorithms that learn from data to make decisions or predictions.
- **Deep Learning (DL):** A subset of ML that uses multi-layered neural networks to model complex patterns in data.

## Areas of AI

- **Symbolic AI:** Uses explicit rules and logic to represent knowledge and reasoning.  
  _Example:_ Early AI programs that used logic-based rules.
- **Expert Systems:** AI systems designed to mimic human expert decision-making using a set of rules.  
  _Example:_ Medical diagnosis systems.
- **Why Expert Systems Failed:** They were brittle, hard to scale, and required extensive manual rule creation, limiting adaptability.

## How Machine Learning Differs from Previous Systems

- ML learns patterns from data rather than relying on manually coded rules.
- It adapts to new data and can improve over time.
- _Example:_ Instead of coding rules for spam detection, ML models learn from examples of spam and non-spam emails.

## Deep Learning and Its Importance

- ML has limitations in handling very complex data patterns and large-scale data.
- Deep Learning overcomes these by using deep neural networks that automatically learn hierarchical features.
- DL is better than traditional ML in tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

## Simple Applications of Deep Learning

- Image and video recognition (e.g., facial recognition).
- Voice assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa).
- Autonomous vehicles.

## Summary

This lecture covers the distinctions between AI, ML, and DL, explores symbolic AI and expert systems, explains why expert systems failed, and highlights the significance of deep learning in overcoming machine learning limitations with practical examples.
